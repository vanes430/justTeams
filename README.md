3. Restart the server to generate configuration files
4. Configure `config.yml` to your needs
5. Reload with `/team reload`

### Cross-Server Setup

For network-wide team synchronization with instant updates:

1. Install JustTeams on all network servers
2. Set up shared MySQL database
3. Configure `config.yml` with MySQL connection details:
   ```yaml
   storage:
     type: "mysql"
     mysql:
       host: "your-mysql-host"
       port: 3306
       database: "justteams"
       username: "your-username"
       password: "your-password"
   ```
4. **(Optional but Recommended)** Enable Redis for instant sync:
   ```yaml
   redis:
     enabled: true
     host: "your-redis-host"
     port: 6379
     password: ""
   ```

### Customizing Embed Colors

Discord uses **decimal color codes** for embeds. Convert hex to decimal:

**Common Colors:**
| Color | Hex | Decimal | Use Case |
|-------|-----|---------|----------|
| 🟢 Green | `#58C27D` | 5763719 | Success events (create, join) |
| 🔴 Red | `#ED4245` | 15548997 | Destructive events (kick, delete) |
| 🔵 Blue | `#5DADE2` | 5814783 | Info events (rename, toggle) |
| 🟡 Gold | `#FFC300` | 16766720 | Special events (promote, transfer) |
| 🟣 Purple | `#9B59B6` | 10181046 | Economy events (bank) |
| ⚪ Gray | `#95A5A6` | 9807270 | Neutral events |

**Color Converter:** https://www.spycolor.com/ (hex to decimal)

### Rate Limiting & Performance

Prevent Discord API rate limits with built-in rate limiting:

```yaml
webhook:
  rate_limiting:
    enabled: true
    max_per_minute: 20      # Max webhooks per minute
    min_delay_ms: 1000      # 1 second between sends
  
  retry:
    enabled: true
    max_attempts: 3         # Retry failed sends
    retry_delay_ms: 2000    # 2 seconds between retries
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Small Server (1-10 players):** `max_per_minute: 20`
- **Medium Server (10-50 players):** `max_per_minute: 15`, disable spammy events
- **Large Server (50+ players):** `max_per_minute: 10`, only enable critical events

**Disable Spammy Events for Large Servers:**
```yaml
events:
  player_invite:
    enabled: false        # Can be very spammy
  team_pvp_toggle:
    enabled: false        # Players toggle frequently
  team_public_toggle:
    enabled: false        # Not critical
  bank_deposit:
    enabled: false        # High traffic
```

### Multi-Server Setup

For networks with multiple servers, set unique names per server:

**Server 1 (Survival):**
```yaml
webhook:
  server_name: "Survival"
```

**Server 2 (Creative):**
```yaml
webhook:
  server_name: "Creative"
```

**Server 3 (SkyBlock):**
```yaml
webhook:
  server_name: "SkyBlock"
```

All servers can use the **same webhook URL** - the `{server}` placeholder differentiates them in Discord.

### Advanced: Custom Embed Formatting

Full control over Discord embed appearance:

```yaml
events:
  team_create:
    enabled: true
    
    # Embed color (decimal)
    color: 5763719
    
    # Main title with emoji
    title: "🎉 New Team Created"
    
    # Description with Discord markdown
    description: "**{player}** created a new team!"
    
    # Enable/disable fields section
    show_fields: true
    
    # Custom fields (up to 25 fields per embed)
    fields:
      - name: "Team Name"
        value: "{team}"
        inline: true          # Display side-by-side
      
      - name: "Team Tag"
        value: "`{tag}`"      # Inline code formatting
        inline: true
      
      - name: "Owner"
        value: "{player}"
        inline: true
      
      - name: "Members"
        value: "{member_count}/10"
        inline: false         # Full width
    
    # Footer text with icon
    footer: "Team created on {server}"
    
    # Show timestamp
    timestamp: true
```

**Discord Markdown Support:**
- `**bold**` → **bold**
- `*italic*` → *italic*
- `__underline__` → __underline__
- `` `code` `` → `code`
- `~~strikethrough~~` → ~~strikethrough~~

### Troubleshooting Webhooks

**Webhooks not sending:**
1. Verify webhook URL is correct (copy from Discord)
2. Check `enabled: true` in webhooks.yml
3. Enable debug mode in config.yml: `debug: true`
4. Review console for webhook errors
5. Test webhook URL with online tester: https://discohook.org/

**Discord says "Invalid Webhook Token":**
- Webhook URL was deleted/regenerated in Discord
- Copy new webhook URL from Discord webhook settings

**Messages not appearing:**
- Check Discord channel permissions for webhook
- Verify webhook is not muted/disabled
- Check rate limiting (may be queued)

**Rate limit errors (429):**
- Reduce `max_per_minute` in config
- Disable unnecessary events
- Increase `min_delay_ms` between sends

**Getting Help:**
Enable debug logging to see detailed webhook activity:
```yaml
# config.yml
settings:
  debug: true
```

Console will show:
```
[DEBUG] Webhook sent: TEAM_CREATE for team "TheBuilders"
[DEBUG] Webhook response: 204 No Content (success)
[DEBUG] Rate limit: 5/20 webhooks sent this minute
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Connection Pooling

HikariCP connection pooling for optimal performance:

**`config.yml` - Connection Pool Settings:**
```yaml
connection_pool:
  # H2 defaults: max_size=4, min_idle=1
  # MySQL defaults: max_size=10, min_idle=3
  max_size: 10              # Maximum connections
  min_idle: 3               # Minimum idle connections
  
  # Timeouts in milliseconds
  idle_timeout: 300000      # 5 minutes
  max_lifetime: 1800000     # 30 minutes
  connection_timeout: 30000 # 30 seconds
  validation_timeout: 5000  # 5 seconds
  
  # Connection testing
  connection_test_query: "SELECT 1"
  
  # Leak detection (0 = disabled)
  leak_detection_threshold: 0
```

Benefits:
- Reuses database connections (no overhead per query)
- Automatic connection health checks
- Graceful recovery from network issues
- Optimal for both H2 and MySQL

---

### Redis Real-Time Sync

For large networks, enable Redis for instant cross-server updates:

**`config.yml` - Redis Configuration:**
```yaml
redis:
  enabled: true
  host: "localhost"
  port: 6379
  password: ""
  use_ssl: false
  timeout: 5000             # Connection timeout (ms)
  
  pool:
    max_total: 20           # Max total connections
    max_idle: 10            # Max idle connections
    min_idle: 2             # Min idle connections
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- **<100ms latency** for cross-server updates (measured in production)
- Instant GUI refresh across all servers
- Real-time notifications to affected players
- No polling overhead

**MySQL Fallback:**
- If Redis unavailable, automatically falls back to MySQL polling
- 1-second polling interval ensures updates still propagate
- Data always persists in MySQL for reliability

---

### Async Operations

All database operations run asynchronously to prevent server lag:

```yaml
settings:
  async_database_operations: true
```

**Async Operations:**
- Team creation, disband, rename
- Member add, remove, role updates
- Permission changes
- Bank transactions
- Home/warp updates
- All admin GUI actions

**Main Thread Operations:**
- GUI opens/closes
- Player teleportation
- Inventory updates

---

### Folia Support

JustTeams is fully compatible with Folia's regionized threading:

- All operations are region-aware
- No global state modifications
- Safe concurrent team operations
- Optimal performance on Folia servers
- Tested on Folia 1.21+

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# In plugin.yml
folia-supported: true
```

---

### Single Server Optimization

For standalone servers, enable single-server mode:

```yaml
settings:
  single_server_mode: true
```

**Optimizations When Enabled:**
- Disables cross-server sync features
- Reduces MySQL query overhead
- Skips Redis connection attempts
- Faster team operations (no sync delay)
- Best used with H2 database

---

### Performance Tips

**For Single Servers:**
- Use H2 database (`storage.type: "h2"`)
- Enable `single_server_mode: true`
- Disable Redis (`redis.enabled: false`)

**For Small Networks (2-5 servers):**
- Use MySQL with default connection pool (max_size: 10)
- Enable Redis for instant sync
- Keep `single_server_mode: false`

**For Large Networks (5+ servers):**
- Use MySQL with larger connection pool (max_size: 20)
- Enable Redis with larger pool (max_total: 30)
- Consider dedicated MySQL/Redis servers
- Monitor connection pool usage in debug mode

**General Optimization:**
- Disable unused features in `config.yml` (`features` section)
- Reduce `home_cooldown` and `warp_cooldown` if not needed
- Use MiniMessage formatting sparingly in high-traffic messages
- Enable async operations (default: true)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"You are not in a team"**
- Player has left or been kicked from team
- Team was disbanded by owner or admin
- Cross-server desync (run `/team reload` or wait 1 second)

**Team not syncing across servers**
- Verify MySQL connection in console logs
- Check `storage.type: "mysql"` in config.yml
- Confirm same MySQL database on all servers
- Test with `/team admin` → View team on different server
- If using Redis, verify connection with `redis.enabled: true`

**Redis not connecting**
- Check Redis server is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Verify host/port in config.yml
- Check password if Redis requires authentication
- Review console logs for connection errors
- Plugin will auto-fallback to MySQL if Redis fails

**Admin GUI not opening**
- Verify permission: `justteams.command.admin`
- Check console for errors
- Ensure MySQL/H2 database is accessible
- Try `/team reload` to refresh configurations

**Ender chest items disappearing**
- Database connection issue (check MySQL status)
- Verify `features.team_enderchest: true`
- Check for storage corruption (backup database)
- Ensure same database across all servers

**Team chat not working**
- Verify `character: "#"` is set (not empty)
- Check `team_chat.character_enabled: true`
- Ensure player has toggled team chat: `/team chat`
- Review `team_chat.format` in config.yml

**Bank balance incorrect**
- Check Vault plugin is installed and loaded
- Verify economy plugin (EssentialsX, CMI, etc.) is working
- Review console for economy errors
- Use Admin GUI to view/adjust balance

**Home/Warp cooldown not working**
- Verify player doesn't have bypass permission
- Check cooldown values in config.yml
- Review `home_cooldown` and `warp_cooldown` settings

**"Feature is disabled"**
- Check `features` section in config.yml
- Ensure specific feature is set to `true`
- Restart server after changing features
- Some features require dependencies (Vault for bank)

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging in `config.yml`:
```yaml
settings:
  debug: true
```

This will output:
- Database query execution times
- Redis publish/subscribe events
- Team cache operations
- Cross-server sync latency
- Permission checks
- GUI open/close events
- All command executions

**Debug Log Examples:**
```
[DEBUG] Team created: TeamName (UUID: 12345)
[DEBUG] MySQL query executed in 15ms: SELECT * FROM teams WHERE id = ?
[DEBUG] Redis published MEMBER_KICKED update for team: TeamName
[DEBUG] Cross-server sync latency: 87ms
[DEBUG] Team cache updated for player: PlayerName
```

### Database Troubleshooting

**MySQL Connection Issues:**
1. Verify MySQL server is running
2. Check credentials in config.yml
3. Test connection: `mysql -h HOST -u USER -p DATABASE`
4. Review `connection_timeout` and `socket_timeout` settings
5. Check firewall allows MySQL port (3306)

**H2 Database Corruption:**
1. Stop server
2. Backup `plugins/JustTeams/teams.db`
3. Delete corrupted database
4. Restart server (new database created)
5. Import from backup if available

**Slow Database Performance:**
1. Enable `debug: true` to measure query times
2. Check connection pool settings (increase if needed)
3. Verify database server resources (CPU, RAM, disk I/O)
4. Consider dedicated database server for large networks
5. Review slow query logs on MySQL

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:
